# lotto-java
A simple CLI program emulating italian lottery draws, written in Java.
The standard italian lottery, known as "Estrazioni del Lotto", is based on 10 urns, named after 10 italian cities. There's also the Nazionale (national) urn.
You can choose how many numbers you want to bet, on which urn, how much money to bet. The system randomly generates 5 numbers for each 
urn, then calculates how many numbers you've guessed correctly and calculates the total win and the net win (total win minus taxes).
